Employed SUMO for simulations, comparing scenarios with 10% and 50% buses. Discovered that the latter significantly enhanced route data, reducing congestion duration and improving average speed. Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm and observed superior results compared to previous scenarios. Used Python, including the Traci method, for data extraction and algorithm implementation.
